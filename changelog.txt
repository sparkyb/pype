(PyPE 1.1)
(cleaned) I did some house cleaning and started using wxNewId to generate
event ids rather than doing them manually.  This required a few tweaks to the
menu generation code, but it cleaned up nicely.  It is also quite consistent
now (wheee, consistency).
(cleaned) I also added a few more functions to deal with previously opened
files easier.
(added) wxSplitterWindow control to hold some extra goodies on the left of the
window.  Just wait for what I have in store for you.  As the controls that I
have added do not support keypress events (other than the menu alt-commands),
hot-keys are only useful when a document is open, or when you haven't touched
the splitter bar or other controls after documents have been closed.
(confirmed) The line ending corruption fix for 1.0.1 seem to be working great.
(fixed) Discovered and removed a bug when inserting a comment would mess up
line endings in the surrounding lines, making it look like there was an extra
blank line inserted on windows systems.  Replaced a '+1' with
'+len(win.format)'.  I like easy fixes.
(tweaked) Line ending detection so that it does something a bit more
intelligent.  It works better on strange files now.
(fixed) undoing and redoing previously wouldn't mark the document as being
'dirty', this is fixed and merged with the code for cut and paste making the
document dirty through the use of a dictionary.  This brings up the question
as to whether or not ALL keypress events should just be a dictionary lookup
rather than a sequence of if, elif, else statements.  They probably should.
Maybe in the next minor version.
(removed) the aforementioned splitter window for now.
(cleaned) up the handling of many of the hotkeys that are used via a
ctrl-<key> combinations.  Basically all but two of the ctrl hotkeys are in a
dictionary for O(1) lookups.  I like that.
(reorganized) some of the menu command locations.
(added) pathmark support.  Viewing pathmarks, editing pathmarks, deleting
pathmarks and saving pathmarks to the configuration file.  MMM, pathmarks.
(added) more status bar text updates, like closing, opening, creating new, and
other such things.  I like updates.
(fixed) undoing and redoing of changing tabs is now done by the entire block
that was tabbed/untabbed, not by the individual line as before.
(discovered) how to use the shift and control clicking of the scope-based
collapseable blocks.  Updated the help to explain how they work.
(contemplated) adding drag and drop support.  After spending some time mucking
around it, I have decided it can wait until the next minor release.
(contemplated) adding code snippet support.  It's where you have a listing of
named code snippets that double clicking will cause to replace the current
selection (or insert at the current cursor position).  I'm trying to decide
how/where to place the code snippets.  I've come to enjoy having a full screen
for editing code, and to lose some of it to code snippets, almost seems
strange.  It'll probably be in the next point release with file drag and drop
support.


(PyPE 1.0.1)
(fixed) Thanks to a message from Lunar Linux guru Jeff Hodges, I was turned on
to Pychecker.sourceforge.net and have discovered two previously unknown
unpassed arguments to functions.  While pychecker is useful, it returns alot
of variable not used errors.  I'll use it before every .n version release
after I do a couple more feature additions.
(fixed) Also thanks to Jeff Hodges, I discovered a bug in 1.0 that will tend
to produce line endings that are \r\r\n...which is wrong, for ANY system.  It
is now fixed.  It had to do with reading and writing files in ascii mode, not
in binary mode.  Apparently it makes a difference in terms of line endings.
Who knew?
