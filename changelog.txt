(PyPE 1.0.1)
(fixed) Thanks to a message from Lunar Linux guru Jeff Hodges, I was turned on
to Pychecker.sourceforge.net and have discovered two previously unknown
unpassed arguments to functions.  While pychecker is useful, it returns alot
of variable not used errors.  I'll use it before every .n version release
after I do a couple more feature additions.
(fixed) Also thanks to Jeff Hodges, I discovered a bug in 1.0 that will tend
to produce line endings that are \r\r\n...which is wrong, for ANY system.  It
is now fixed.  It had to do with reading and writing files in ascii mode, not
in binary mode.  Apparently it makes a difference in terms of line endings.
Who knew?
