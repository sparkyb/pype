#-------------------------------- PyPE 2.2.1 ---------------------------------
(fixed) exception when creating a new document.

#--------------------------------- PyPE 2.2 ----------------------------------
(removed) a debug statement or two.
(added) installation section to readme.
(fixed) a bug where new saved documents wouldn't close, and their states
wouldn't be saved.
(changed) when switching to a different document (for any reason), PyPE now
selects the editor portion of the window.  Previously if one selected the tab
of a document, or a document in the document tab, it would keep those
particular items selected, resulting in strange arrow/typing behavior.
(fixed) when changing menu item names, previously one needed to choose a
hotkey in order to make name changes stick (then clearing the hotkey if
necessary).  Now your changes will take effect as long as you keep clicking
'OK'.
(changed) tweaked the C/C++ indentation on {} rules to more closely match the
most common style guides.
(added) 'public' keyword to pyrex syntax highlighting.
(changed) When selecting an item from the results in the 'search' tab, the
exact item that was found will be selected if possible.  Possible incorrect
selection conditions:
 * if the file contents have changed, the same line number where the match was
originally found will be selected, if it exists
 * if one is searching for a string that is quoted or commented, and something
that matches is discovered before the quote or comment, that earlier match
will be shown instead
(fixed) currently untitled documents will now have their 'file name' displayed
in the search results.
(fixed) choosing an untitled document in the 'search' tab will now go to the
proper file.
(fixed) the search tab will now not duplicate entries in the 'selected text',
'current file', 'current file with includes', or 'open files' scopes when
multiple paths are listed in "Directories", and will actually produce results
when there is nothing in "Directories".
(fixed) searching in currently open unicode files (it works now), unicode
files on disk still have issues.
(changed) the 'to be searched for' string in the 'search' tab now supports
string escaping like the find/replace bars.
(changed) if your search string for the 'search' tab includes at least one
line ending, then multiline will be automatically enabled during the search,
but will not be shown in the options.
(added) for unicode-enabled versions: PyPE will respect the "Encoding
declaration" during file load, as specified in the "Python Reference Manual"
aka the "Language Reference", if no Byte Order Mark (BOM) is present.  It will
also alert the user to any failure in decoding the loaded file.
(added) for unicode-enabled versions: if Document->Encodings is set to
'other', PyPE will attempt to encode the file as specified in the "Encoding
declaration", and will alert the user on failure to encode the file.
Note: PyPE will not add/alter/change the encoding declaration, but it will
respect them.
(added) for unicode-enabled versions: a tab next to Shell which produces the
repr() of a given block of text.  Not a huge feature, but convenient for
working with unicode and Python consoles.
(added) View->Go to position for jumping to a particular position in a file.
Note that this may be slow on large files because Scintilla uses an internal
utf-8 representation.  This means that in order to find the current position
in the file, one must necessarily iterate up to that position to discover all
multibyte characters.  This is further uglified by Scintilla considering
Windows line endings '\r\n' as a single character in stc.GetPositionAfter().
(changed) non-unicode versions of PyPE will use history.txt and menu.txt to
store preferences.  unicode enabled versions of PyPE will use history.u.txt
and menu.u.txt to store preferences.
(added) Options->Findbar below editor option, when unchecked, find/replace
bars will be above the editor instead of below it.
(added) shell command support and interaction embedded in PyPE, or embedded
within a new terminal (on Windows, the terminal only exists if necessary, on
other platforms, it uses xterm so the terminal may exist even if it is not
necessary).
(fixed) creating a new document (via menu or hotkey) will now focus the cursor
in the new document.
(fixed) selecting search context (directories, current files, etc.) in the
search tab will now disable options which are not relevant to the current
search context.
(updated) readme.txt


#-------------------------------- PyPE 2.1.1 ---------------------------------
(fixed) a bug where PyPE would fail to load if the user had run certain PyPE
beta releases.
(fixed) a bug where win and win-unicode versions would fail to load if PyPE
couldn't find your home directory.


#--------------------------------- PyPE 2.1 ----------------------------------
(fixed) a bug when saving a file at the root of a drive on Windows wouldn't
quite work.
(fixed) a bug that would cause windows-unicode using versions of PyPE to not
realize they were unicode-enabled when they were installed in a path without
'-unicode' contained in them.
(changed) PyPE no longer saves state information (bookmarks, folding, etc.)
about a document if the document is different from what is on disk.
(changed) Opening a document that has a different md5 than what PyPE last saw
now ignores saved cursor position information, bookmarks, and folding for that
opened document.
(fixed) broken state saving when documents are closed individually.
(changed) increased the recent document memory from 64 to 128 documents.
(added) portion to parser to pull out cdef names for Pyrex files.
(added) keywords and filename masks for Pyrex files (uses the Python lexer and
settings).
(added) auto-indent/dedent on 'enter' keypress for C code, based on curly
braces '{}' and the existance of 'return' as the first non-whitespace item on
the line.
(fixed) an issue where documents listed in the documents tab would not have
their modified '*' prefix set or reset properly unless the document was
dragged around (and sometimes not even then).
(fixed) updated definition of findbar.ReplaceBar.setup to make
findbar.FindBar.setup unnecessary.
(changed) renamed Document->Indent Width to Document->Set Indent Width, which
may remove the hotkey if someone had one bound to that menu item.
(fixed) Settings loading/saving options in per-document settings.
(added) Jumping forward and backward to matched parens, braces, etc.  See
View->Jump Forward and View->Jump Backward (if you use these, you should set
a hotkey or two).
(added) Triggers functionality.  Works in a similar fashion to TextMate's
triggers, and can be used in a similar fashion to TextMate's Smart typing.
(removed) unused code relating to the browsable source tree, which fixes some
bugs for those using a recent version of wxPython.
(added) option to relocate the Todo tab to between the Line and Documents tab,
see Options->Wide Todo .
(fixed) when double-clicking on a result in the Search tab, will now make sure
that the line is actually displayed, unfolding if necessary.
(added) optional toolbar with many common functions.  Check
Options->Show Toolbar .
(added) '//' commenting for C/C++.  I had also added '<!-- -->' commenting for
xml/html, but I have disabled it due to the fact that that such comments do
not nest (which is also why I went with '//' for C/C++ instead of /* */).
(added) filters to browse tab (previous wxPython versions didn't really
support multiple filters per entry very well).


#------------------------------ PyPE 2.0 Beta 3 ------------------------------
(fixed) if saving the results of find-in-files requires unicode, it will
automatically encode the output file into utf-8, which only matters on systems
with unicode filenames and/or file contents.
(removed) saving the results of find-in-files.
(fixed) behavior of ctrl+f when text is selected to insert escaped text (when
the selected text is not unicode and escapes are necessary).
(fixed) find-as-you-type in the findbar, it was broken after I added
shift+enter for 'find previous'.
(fixed) Document->Indent Width works again.
(changed) todo list now uses table object from find in files.
(fixed) sorting and clicking on todo items.
(fixed) off-by-1 numbering error on line numbers for find in files items.
(changed) multiline search in find in files now produces line numbers and
multiple results.
(fixed) workspace saving that would destroy other workspaces.
(fixed) bug where reducing the size of the bottom toolbar would crash the
editor.
(added) find in files features with help from Dave Schuyler:
(added) various scopes in which to search: selected text, current file,
current file with includes (works for Python and C files), open files,
directories, and tags in directories.
(added) options when searching: whole word, quoted, and commented.
(added) filename and extension exclusion.
(added) viewing results as a table or tree, in addition to plain text.
(changed) name of "find in files" to "search", in order to be more
representative of what the tab is currently capable of.
-- beginning of find in files features written or helped by Dave Schuyler
(added) findbar features with help from Dave Schuyler:
(updated) the behavior of smartcasing to be 'more smart', updated the readme.
(changed) find/replace bars now remember their status per-document.
(chanegd) find/replace bars now have a history of search/replace terms.
-- end of findbar features written or helped by Dave Schuyler
(fixed) saving of files with unicode characters (was caused by writing unicode
strings to standard out without converting them to an ascii representation
first).  Now uses a string.encode('utf8') before writing to standard out.
(added) wx.Yield() calls to the bit that handles the discovery of Python
imports in the find in files tab for PyPE responsiveness during large file
scans.
(fixed) printing of status messages to the log tab now occur even if the log
does not yet exist (users get to see some startup messages now).
(fixed) keyboard navigation of the find/replace bars to be cyclic.
(added) ability to clear the find/replace history of the find/replace bars.
(fixed) parsing of C files in search tab.
(fixed) search "current file and includes" for Python files to not try files
multiple times.
(added) window title now includes filenames (thanks Dave Schuyler).
(fixed) behavior of caret options, will now update all editor controls when
settings are changed.
(added) ability to disable find/replace bar history.
(added) ability to change what the title bar displays.
(moved) all editor-global options to a new 'Options' menu, any previous
hotkeys for these options are lost.  Original locations of affected options:
Edit->Enable File Drops, View->Editor on Top, View->Editor on Left,
View->Caret Options, View->Set Caret M Value, View->Set Caret N Value,
Document->Save Settings, Help->Change Menus, Edit->Use Findbar History,
Edit->Clear Findbar History, View->Title Options.
(fixed) bug with find and replace bars and unicode.
(changed) find/replace bars now use the compiler module to discover the actual
strings when Python-style string constants are used, removing PyPE's reliance
on 'eval'.
(fixed) the construction of binary distribution to force compression on the
library.zip file, drastically reducing the size from nearly 7 megs to just
over 4 megs.  Not quite as good as PyPE 1.9.3's 3 megs, but wxPython has grown
somewhat, as has PyPE's reliance on additional wxPython widgets.
(note) I will begin posting md5 and sha1 checksums in the sourceforge notes
as requested by a user.
(changed) the names and descriptions of some items in the Options menu.
(added) per-filetype document preferences (everything in the Document menu
except for "line ending" and "syntax highlighting"), savable and loadable via
Options->Save Settings and Options->Load Settings respectively.  If a document
without any previous preferences is loaded, it gets these settings loaded by
default.  Individual documents will remember any settings that are set for
them, and can be reset via Options->Load Settings.
(fixed) the display of help text in the status bar for some menu options.


#------------------------------ PyPE 2.0 Beta 2 ------------------------------
(fixed) Todo no longer includes http, ftp, mailto, news, gopher, and telnet.
(fixed) Bug when opening non-existent files.
(fixed) When one indents/dedents selected text, the selection will change to
select the entirety of all lines covered (similar to the way comment/uncomment
does).
(removed) Find/Replace dialog.
(added) Replace bar with 'replace' and 'replace all' functionality.
(added) "Escape" key now closes find bar or replace bar, if any of their text
entry locations have focus.
(added) Option to disable drag and drop file support on the editor window,
though it is still enabled other places.
(added) Help information about Edit->Enable File Drops
(added) Ability to replace a workspace during save of workspace.
(added) Find in files tab to the notebook on the bottom bar.
(removed) Find in files dialog.
(added) Ability to save the results of a 'find in files' search to a text
file.
(added) Option to move bottom bar to the top, and/or right bar to the left.
(added) Smart Case replacements.  When the replacement string is as long as
the replaced string, and smart case is enabled, it will automatically adjust
the case of all replacement strings.  See the readme for more information.
(added) Replace in selection.  When used with "replace all", will perform a
"replace all" only on everything in the selection when the button was clicked.
(fixed) removed reporting of exception when PyPE attempts to change to a path
that doesn't exist anymore.
(removed) some unused blocks of code.
(removed) some unused ids.
(moved) "next/previous tab" entries to "View" menu (for hotkey support).
(fixed) Issue when PyPE is running during daylight savings time changes (known
bug for over a year) where user would be notified that all documents currently
open have had the on-disk versions changed.  Only documents that are actually
different from their on-disk versions will cause a notification.
(fixed) Issue when someone saves a file with identical content over a file
that is currently open but unchanged.
(fixed) When loading/saving files on any platform where the filesystem is
case-insensitive, but case-preserving, PyPE will respect the capitalization
of files (users may need to clear out their .pype profiles to get full use of
this).
(fixed) When saving a document, the icon for the document above the editor
will be the same as in the documents tab.
(fixed) When saving the last document, which happens to be unnamed, will no
longer change the current document selection.
(added) Caret 'sloppiness', which restricts the cursor position as you are
typing or moving the caret.  Check out View->Caret Options (of which there are
5).
(changed) The layout of the find/replace bars.
(added) repeated ctrl+f commands will perform repeated find next operations.
(changed) F3 will now only find next if there already existed a find/replace
bar, no longer creating one if it did not exist.
(changed) ctrl+f/r will insert selected text into the 'to find' text.
(changed) if there is already text in the 'to find' text in the find/replace
bar, and no text is selected in the editor, then the 'to find' text will not
be replaced.
(changed) if there is no text in the 'to find' text in the find/replace bar,
and the cursor is on a word, it will be inserted into the 'to find' text box.
(added) if the 'to find' box has focus, shift+enter will find previous.
(fixed) encodings changing code for unicode builds.
(fixed) detection of unicode for newer versions of wxPython.
(added) ability to disable wrapping during find.
(fixed) nameerror during the opening of a document when a previous version of
PyPE had never been run.


#------------------------------ PyPE 2.0 Beta 1 ------------------------------
(changed) Pulled source tree from being per-document to being shared among all
documents, tree is rebuilt on document switch.
(changed) Each document gets its own tree, but it shares the same visible area,
using .Show() and .Hide() tricks so that only one is visible at one time (the
one for the current document).  Tree is not rebuilt on document swap.
(fixed) On document refresh, tree is destroyed and rebuilt, fix for the
non-removal of some removed functions/classes from the tree after they had
been deleted from the document.
(fixed) a bug involving non-reloaded but modified files not asking for save on
document close or PyPE exit.
(removed) pathmarks menu.
(removed) shell commands menu.
(added) browsable filesystem tab.
(added) pathmarks to browsable filesystem tab.
(added) document list tab, drag and drop reordering of documents.
(removed) tabs menu (use the document list)
(added) icons for documents wherever possible.
(added) logging mechanism (for bug reports and whatnot).
(added) most status bar updates go to the log.
(added) second browsable source tree, one sorted by line, the other sorted by
name.
(added) find-bar per document (try ctrl-f).
(fixed) redraw of document editor after transition between dirty/nondirty and
opening new files.
(moved) much of the non-main window code to a plugins directory.
Functionality should be unchanged, but easier to edit.
(changed) started transition to wx namespace.
(added) 'todos' can now have any category.
(removed) code snippets, may appear in a later PyPE release if people want
snippets.
(fixed) wrap selected text, now uses textwrap for paragraph wrapping.
(added) workspace management, can now save and load a document listing, try
it!
(fixed) parser now (poorly) understands __init__ and __new__, tooltips will
now show __init__ and/or __new__ methods when available for a class.
(fixed) main window and all sub windows now remember size and position.
(fixed) line and column indicators when the keyboard is not used to move the
cursor.
(updated) documentation, AKA readme.txt.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.9.3 ---------------------------------
(changed) find now searches from the current cursor position, rather than the
beginning (search down) or end (search up).
(removed) event binding for EVT_STC_POSCHANGED, which has been removed in
2.5.1.5.
(fixed) a bug that resulted from opening an empty file.
(fixed) a bug that resulted from opening a file without line endings.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.9.2 ---------------------------------
(improved) the find and find/replace dialogs will now remember the case, whole
word setting, and direction (if applicable) for the last time the find/replace
button was pressed.
(fixed) various refresh bugs have been fixed.
(fixed) syntax highlighting bug in PyPE 1.9.1


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.9.1 ---------------------------------
(improved) the speed of PyPE closing down with many documents open.
(fixed) old hotkeys and menu items that are no longer being used are now
removed upon restarting PyPE.
(fixed) The #!/ shortcut at the beginning of pype.py now points to:
'#!/usr/bin/env python', which should find Python on most every *nix system.
(fixed) a bug reported by Denis Dube when using the binary in which running
'pype.exe <filename>' would result in syntax highlighting not being available.


#--------------------------------- PyPE 1.9 ----------------------------------
(fixed) a bug that resulted in PyPE closing down without warning if the Find
or Find/Replace dialog was attempted to be open while another was already
opened.
(added) a dialog and support code for changing menu item names and hot-key
bindings.  This has been in the works for a while, and hopefully will get some
use.  Even though the description of this change is only a few lines long, the
implementation is over 250 lines.  The current implementation is limited to
adding hotkeys to items that are in the main menus and do not contain
submenus.  Any hotkey combination desired will likely work (Shift+Tab seems to
have a problem due to the automatic button/entry navigation in dialogs, and
likely other platform-specific key combinations will not work).
(cleaned) out most (if not all) old hotkey-support in OnKeyPressed, now all
menu hotkeys are a dictionary lookup.
(fixed) maximizing and restoring will now result in more stable browsable
source tree widths.
(changed) parsing has been moved back into the core process and is multiplexed
with wxYield() calls.  External parsing is not required with the fast parser
and wxYield.  If you want to know why it was moved to an external process
previously, check the changelog.txt included with PyPE.  By not doing any
external IO, polling files, spawning processes, etc., parsing the file and
updating all the requisite information is roughly twice as fast as it was in
1.8.2.
(tossed) all the unused external process parser stuff.  No need for it now.
(information and change) there are now two things that can occur that take up
a measurable amount of time in-process: parsing and finding in files.  Both
call wxYield() in order to offer the the GUI some time to update if needed.
Great pains have been taken so that 'find in files' will not occur during a
wxYield call of the parser, nor will two 'find in files' occur simultaneously.
(fixed) the listbox control in 'find in files' seemed to have issues with tabs
displaying correctly.  On display they are automatically replaced with the
PyPE's default number of spaces per tab.
(fixed) the forgotten re import that allows for regular expression searches
in 'find in file'
(fixed) 'replace all' will now be considered a single modification for the
purpose of undo/redo.
(now included) is a modified version of wxProject.py that supports the file
list as a dragNdrop file source.  For those who want a /really/ ghetto project
manager, this version of wxProject.py is for you.  Does not work properly when
run with a unicode-enabled wxPython.  I have no idea why.
(received) patches to PyPE from Relja Stanisavljevic (no SFID given), which
resulted in the following (after fixes were applied):
1. 'Find Again' menu item and functionality.
2. Untitled documents now have unique numbers, tabs are now named <untitled #>
3. Comment and uncomment code does the right thing for indented blocks.
A big thank you goes out to Relja Stanisavljevic.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.8.2 ---------------------------------
(added) an option to allow PyPE to save cursor position information in a
document.  Even though I don't use such a thing (and loathe it), others may
like such a feature.
(fixed) a bug with the backlog of saved states that would crash PyPE on load
when enough documents had been opened.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.8.1 ---------------------------------
(fixed) a bug with 'Open Last', in that it wouldn't actually open the
documents that were open when PyPE was last closed.
(fixed) a bug described here:
1. Open some documents
2. Close PyPE (saving if required)
3. Open PyPE (don't load any documents)
4. Close PyPE
5. Open PyPE.
A user would notice that no documents closed in step 2 will have their states
saved.  As they are recently open documents, they (in version 1.8.1 and on)
become part of the 64 most recent that get their states saved in addition to
those documents closed when PyPE closes.
(fixed) Updated some methods in the most recent queue to follow the dictionary
standard of mapping(zip(map_instance.keys(), map_instance.values())) producing
an equivalency to the original map_instance.
(fixed) When calltips are shown, the class/method heirarchy for the function
prototypes are now in the proper case (they were previously all in lowercase).


#--------------------------------- PyPE 1.8 ----------------------------------
(information) the bug that was fixed in PyPE 1.7.3 removed every file in the
path '<user profile>/.pype', including the history.txt that kept user profile
information.  During the update, sourceforge went down for maintenance, and I
was expected at a friend's party.  It was eventually uploaded.
(added) Every per-document setting that can be set, will be perserved if PyPE
was closed with the document open.
(added) The 64 most recently closed documents will have their state
information saved, just like if PyPE was closed with them open.  These 64
documents are in addition to those with states saved when PyPE closes.
(removed) the ability to hide the fold margin (which had a bug in it since its
introduction anyways).  Hiding the fold margin when code is folded can lead to
data corruption.  If one hits 'return' on a folded line, all hidden lines that
are hidden through the result of the fold are deleted.  If the margin were
hidden, then it would be impossible to either fold or unfold, so I just got
rid of the ability to hide the margin.
(fixed) shell commands can now have arguments.  This has likely been a long
standing bug.
(changed) made the default syntax highlighting for a new document to be set by
the user, defaulting to python.
(fixed) PyPE has a new icon and is set up to use the new icon in the titlebar
and taskbar (on platforms where this makes sense).
(added) Find in files dialog as requested by user francescoa at sourceforge.
(added) Save information about the last 10 unique values in each entry in the
find in files dialog.
(fixed) bug
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=856727&group_id=85104&atid=574958


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.7.3 ---------------------------------
(fixed) a stupid bug that was caused by fixing a stupid bug.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.7.2 ---------------------------------
(fixed) I forgot to remove a debug line that keeps copies of every document
that gets parsed in a user's profile.
(fixed) a bug when dedenting a single line with the cursor near the beginning
of the line.
(fixed) a bug that wasn't causing any harm, but was slowing down the loading
of PyPE.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.7.1 ---------------------------------
(fixed) a bug with the 'fold all' menu command that stopped all of the
document from being folded.


#--------------------------------- PyPE 1.7 ----------------------------------
(added) When reloading from disk, a document's browsable source tree, etc.,
will be updated.
(fixed) various problems with the window not being redrawn.
(fixed) some indent/dedent problems.
(added) SPE-style per-document todo list.
(updated) the readme.txt that is included with PyPE.
(changed) the default styling for unknown extensions is now plain text.
(changed) the exceptDialog to show a scrolled text dialog, for easy copy/paste
bug reports.
(fixed) Thanks once again to Villy Dachev, any time the PyPE executable (or
the source vesion was run with the python binary) was run from a path that
contained spaces, it used to have some SERIOUS issues.  They have all been
resolved.
(fixed) a problem when one's user profile was not stored in a path containing
spaces, resulting in a file not being parsed.
(cleaned) up some parser spawning code.
(added) notification to warn users when they attempt to run a script who'se
path contains unicode characters.
(fixed) a difficult to track down bug involving running the source version.
It was the result of taking the location of the PyPE source as sys.argv[0],
which only gives the relative path given the original path when running PyPE.
Too many hours were spent tracking this bug down.  This was likely a long
standing bug.


#------------------------------ PyPE 1.7-test3 -------------------------------
(fixed) 2 problems pointed out by Villy Dachev, and added one feature:
(fixed) a problem with external document modification and refreshing.
(fixed) a problem with running external scripts in the windows binary.  Users
should check this one some more.
(added) a 'fold all' function to the 'Document' menu.


#------------------------------ PyPE 1.7-test2 -------------------------------
(fixed) after using 'save as' or attempting to save a document that was
previously unnamed, PyPE would leave capital letters in the document name
within the document tab, even when the operating system is case agnostic.
This is now fixed.  On systems where case does not matter, the file names will
be consistent in the document tabs.  No change for systems that care about
case in file names.  This has been a long-standing visual bug that was never
noticed.
(fixed) a bug with indentation.  Previously it would always indent using the
default indent during indent/dedent operations (including when hitting return
after a function def, while, etc).  This has been fixed so that indent/dedent
uses the document specified indent.
(changed) Rather than ALWAYS indenting/dedenting the indent width, the first
indent/dedent operation will indent/dedent to the closest proper indentation
position.  That is, if your indent width is k, after indent/dedent operations,
the indentation of a line will be 0 mod k.
(fixed) the text entry dialogs for various numbers in the document tab would
not validate the result, making sure they were > 0, even when such a number
was asked.  They now check.  If the returned value is <= 0, it will keep the
previous value.
(added) when closing down PyPE with open documents, PyPE will remember which
lines were folded and which weren't.
(added) a function to unfold all lines in a document to the 'Document' menu.
(changed) a slight 'Document' menu reorganization.
(tossed) some unused dialog box code.


#------------------------------- PyPE 1.7-test -------------------------------
(changed) when source files are larger than 512k, the slow parser will never
be called.  Why?  Because the slow parser runs around 25 seconds (on my
machine) on such a large piece of Python source, and it stops being useful if
you have to wait so long.
(made faster) Thanks to the input of Jeff Grimmett (no sourceforge id given),
the fast parser is even faster.  He offered a two-pass method that beat my
previous single-pass method by a significant margin.  After more than a dozen
emails back and forth, along with heavy optimization, which one is faster is
still up for debate (there are some inputs where one is ~5% faster, then on
others the other is ~5% faster).  All told, the new fast parser is around 30%
faster than the original fast parser, and includes support for pulling out
calltips, and better function/class listings in the browsable source tree.
Most all the modifications to the parsing for this release is due to the
dialog between Jeff and I.
(fixed) Sometimes parsing would fail due to ambiguous line endings.  This has
been fixed.  All line endings upon load, save, and parsing, are automatically
converted to the most dominant line ending format.
(fixed) fast parsing would ignore tabs, thinking they were not whitespace.
Now it is converted before parsing to spaces, as given by spaces_per_tab in
configuration.py
(fixed) While I am uncertain whether Python supports unicode in function,
class, or variable declarations, fast parsing will not behave any differently
when using unicode or not.
(changed) both parsers now generate a better browsable tree.  The tree
now contains more information about function calls.  It also sorts based on
the names of a function/class, without the leading 'class' or 'def', and
ignores case.
(moved) all the user-changeable configuration in configuration.py to the top
of the file for easy access.
(fixed) when hitting enter on a line with a return or pass statement, the next
line will be dedented properly.
(changed) the way calltips are cancelled.  They are cancelled less often,
which is definitely better.
(changed) due to the fact that the fast parser produces basically everything
about the python source (except for docstrings and multi-line calltip
definitions), PyPE will now use, by default, the fast parser to deal with
parsing.  This is preferred, if only because now tree updates can happen in
under 2 seconds for the majority of source files (on my Celeron 400).
(increased) the size of the browsable source tree when "Show/hide tree" is
used (whether by the menu or hotkey).
(added) a command to hide all the browsable source trees.  Check the 'View'
menu.
(fixed) resizing the window doesn't change the size of the browsable source
trees.  Every open document will have their browsable source tree keep their
sizes during window resize.  It only updates the document that is currently
visible (so no worries about 20 documents slowing down window resize).
(fixed) a bug when using bookmarks.  When going to a bookmark, PyPE will make
sure that the line containing the bookmark is visible.
(changed) basically all those configuration options that were to be edited in
configuration.py have been removed.  They are now available in the 'document'
menu.
(added) option to view/not view line numbers.
(added) option to view/not view bookmark margin.
(added) option to view/not view fold margin.
(added) option to view/not view indentation guide.
(added) option to view/not use tabs.
(added) option to view/not wrap long lines.
(added) option to change indent width.
(added) option to change the tab character's width.
(added) option to change the long line column number.
(added) option to change the long line column indicator.
(added) option to view/change the current line endings.
(added) option to sort the browsable source tree by name or line number.
(added) per-document autocomplete.  Rather than autocomplete being a global
setting, it is now a per-document setting.
(moved) location of encoding and syntax highlighting submenus to the document
menu.


#------------------------------- PyPE 1.6.5.4 --------------------------------
(fixed) a bug when opening up multiple documents that are in the root of a
drive in Windows.  Thank you once again francescoa@sourceforge's for the bug
report and pointing out where it was messing up.


#------------------------------- PyPE 1.6.5.3 --------------------------------
(fixed) a bug when starting up PyPE with more than one relative paths to files
as arguments.  Thanks francescoa@sourceforge's for the bug report.
(discovered) the reason why on some linux systems splitting the window would
not display the source.  Thank you Patrick Installe (did not email through sf)
It turns out to not be a bug with wxPython on linux, but instead it is the
result of one's theme in linux changing how many pixels for each window is
required to be displayed.


#------------------------------- PyPE 1.6.5.2 --------------------------------
(fixed) a bug when creating a newline with tabs disabled and the cursor was in
or immediately to the right of indentation.
(fixed) on linux, opening a document would not display the source, this is
seemingly a bug in wxSplitterWindow on linux.  The split argument I give is
negative, so it should result in a size for the right panel.  It instead makes
the left window non-existant.  The negative argument has been replaced with a
positive argument based on the current notebook size.  No guarantees on
whether either window will be created when the notebook is smaller than 25
pixels wide.
(should have been fixed) seemingly, some of you are having problems opening
files in the root of a drive as well as opening relative paths (in windows).
This has been working for me since PyPE 1.6.2, but I've added in one more
thing.  If you STILL can't open relative paths or a file in the root of a
drive, then the combination of:
os.path.normcase(os.path.normpath(os.path.realpath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), i))))
is not sufficient to get the real and normalized path on Windows.


#------------------------------- PyPE 1.6.5.1 --------------------------------
(fixed) a small bug with the syntax highlighting submenu not updating what
highlighting is being used in non-unicode versions.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.6.5 ---------------------------------
(changed) untitled documents are now labeled as such, rather than not having a
name at all on the tab.
(fixed) a bug where saving a new document, without any changes, would cause
the tab to not be updated.
(fixed) a bug where saving a new document would not add the file to the list
of recently open documents.
(fixed) when reloading a document from disk, PyPE used to allow one to undo to
a point mid-STC.SetText where the document was empty.  This has been fixed.
(made better) for those platforms that support radio items in the menu (wxMSW
and wxGTK according to the docs), the syntax highlighting and encodings
submenus will display a mark next to the current document's syntax
highlighting and encoding.
(fixed) previously when opening a document in windows, an msdos console would
make a momentary appearance, then dissappear.  This has been fixed with the
use of os.spawnv().  Woo.  Thanks Luc Perrin (leblin@sourceforge) for pointing
out the popping of the msdos prompt, I had gotten used to it, and didn't
realize it bothered people.
(two more bugs pointed out by Villy Dachev (labrett@sourceforge)):
(fixed) even if tabs were turned on, if one were to create a new line (through
the use of enter) while the cursor was in the indentation portion of a line,
spaces would be inserted, rather than tabs.  Now tabs are inserted.
(fixed) if tabs were turned on, the search for whether or not a new line (when
hitting enter) should be indented more, would stretch to a previous line.
This has been fixed, and the search is only ever on the current line.


#------------------------------ PyPE 1.6.5-test ------------------------------
(NOTES REGARDING UNICODE SUPPORT) I got some advice from a user who made their
PyPE support utf-8 encodings, did some modification to PyPE, and have actually
implemented the required pieces to give PyPE unicode support.  PyPE now
supports the encodings; ascii, utf-7, utf-8, utf-16, utf-16-be, and utf-16-le,
when using a version of wxPython that includes unicode support.  If you don't
get the 'encodings' submenu in the 'edit' menu, then your version of wxPython
does not support unicode.  In wxPython version 2.4.2.4u, there exists a bug in
reverse searching through unicode files, so I've forced it to only search
forwards.  It should be fixed when the STC gets updated with the latest
scintilla (probably in the next version of wxPython).  There also exists
multiple display bugs with multibyte unicode characters, one of them is listed
here: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=828217&group_id=9863&atid=109863
I'm sorry about the visual bugs, but there is nothing I can do about it.
Other than that, unicode seems to work pretty well.  Bug reports from unicode
users would be great.

(changed) the standard behavior of home and end when word-wrap is enabled.  I
didn't like that hitting 'home' would send you to the beginning of the entire
line, rather than the displayed line, so a little spelunking into the STC docs
resulted in an addition to the OnWrapL code.
(removed) previously there had been a STC-default keybinding of CTRL-T to swap
the current line and the one above it.  I've accidentally hit that one a few
times (I'm a user of mozilla tabs), so I made the default to remove it.  Again
in configuration.py, just set REM_SWAP to 0 to enable it.
(added) when quitting PyPE with documents open, intra-document bookmarks are
also saved (check the 'view' menu for bookmark stuff) and are re-set if those
documents are loaded during the next execution of PyPE (with '--last' command
line option, using file->Open Last, or even opening any file that was open
during program exit using any method).
(added) due to some tips from Villy Dachev (labrett@sourceforge), pointing out
some unicode stuff...it turns out that unicode was very easy to add.  I just
needed to check for the BOM characters at the beginning of a unicode encoded
file and decode the file, then re-encode it when saving to a file.  There is
graceful unicode conversion for standard ascii files when unicode text is
inserted into them.  That is, they are automatically saved as utf-8.
(added) encodings sumbenu to 'edit' menu.  This menu will allow you to change
the encoding of the current file to another.  Changing from utf-16 to utf-8
(for languages that support it) will reduce the storage requirements by about
1/2.
(added) a statusbar field to display the text encoding of the current file.
(removed) information about lexers in pype.py
(moved) 'style' menu into a 'syntax highlighting' submenu of 'view'.
(found) nifty bug.  Hitting ctrl+<period> will let you view the tab to the
right of the current tab.  Hitting Ctrl+del on a US keymap, or Ctrl+<numpad .>
when numlock is off will also switch tabs.  It is nifty.
(fixed) when tabs are enabled, creating a newline should insert tabs.
(added) a variable called spaces_per_tab in configuration.py, which, when tabs
are enabled, replace that many spaces with a tab when creating a new line,
during indentation, etc., and will display tabs as that many spaces wide.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.6.4 ---------------------------------
(NOTES REGARDING UNICODE SUPPORT) I have little (or really no) experience when
it comes to unicode support in Python.  I had mistakenly assumed that creating
a binary using the unicode-supporting wxPython would have been sufficient to
support unicode out of the box.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  There
is encoding and decoding that must be done on either end, and one must know
which encoding to use in order to properly support unicode.  As that adds
additional complication to PyPE, and to the handling of ALL files, regardless
of what extended text is supported, I'll not be producing a binary with
partial unicode support.  Those that have tried saving unicode files in 1.6.3
will notice the problem during saving, and the fact that it doesn't work.
While I am not ruling out the possibility of PyPE fully supporting unicode in
the future, I don't believe I will be implementing it.  My apologies.

(NOTES REGARDING DOCUMENTATION) I know that the documentation is out of date.
I will update it when I get around to it.  I prefer to make PyPE better than
to spend my time updating the documentation.

(NOTES REGARDING VERSION REQUIREMENTS) I have changed the wxPython version
required.  This is because the wxSTC has a known bug in version 2.4.1.2 that
causes PyPE to exit without warning, possibly causing data loss.  This is bad.
The wxSTC that is included with wxPython version 2.4.2.4 doesn't have this
fatal bug.

#The below bugs/suggestions were reported by francescoa in the PyPE forums at
#Sourceforge or in email.  I have added the features or fixed the bugs.
(fixed) a bug involving pasting to code snippets.
(fixed) a bug involving changing code snippet focus and tab focus (they would
do so simultaneously when changing code snippet focus).
(fixed) running the currently open script in windows when the path to the file
contains spaces.
(removed) an import that was not used.
(added) when using the find/replace dialog, the word that is currently under
the cursor will be inserted into the find/replace dialog find text.
(fixed) the find dialog will now find up or down, depending on the radio item
in the dialog.  Previously it would ignore the 'up' or 'down' choice.
(added) bookmarks within a file, for quickly and easily bookmarking certain
locations for later perusal.

#end of bugs/suggestions reported by francescoa

(replaced) Added file over-write confirmation dialog.
(removed) checkbox for 'readonly' files.  There seems to be no way to get the
status of that 'open file in read-only mode'.  Which is completely retarded.
(cleaned) replaced the indent/dedent code with a call to the STC command for
indent/dedent.
(replaced) the aforementioned calls to the STC indent/dedent with my previous
code.  I prefer the behavior of my code to that of the STC indent/dedent code.
(made better) the dirty flag on the each open document is now consistent with
the last time the user saved thanks to EVT_KEY_UP, STC.SetSavePoint(), and
STC.GetModify().  It is now more accurate and does not rely on the numerous
hacks I did before to make it work.
(fixed) a bug that occurred on windows machines when PyPE would try to delete
the temporary parsing output when it was still opened by the parser.
(added) a statusbar field that displays the current line and column.  It is
only updated when a key is released (EVT_STC_POSCHANGED doesn't seem to work).
To update the display if it is not being updated, tap the CTRL key.
(added) events in the statusbar now have a timestamp when they occur.
(moved) code for wrapping lines into configuration.py
(added) ability to open all the documents previously open in your last PyPE
session if you quit PyPE with those documents saved and have their tabs open.
You can force this behavior on PyPE startup with the FIRST argument on the
command line being '--last'.
(changed) removed the various 'shortcuts' for generating the menus that ended
up taking more lines and being more difficult to edit.  While not reducing the
number of lines (significantly), it does increase readability of the menu
code.
(changed) realized that the ID definitions are only required when you need to
compare event id numbers.  When you don't care, and just want an event to be
posted, then event declarations are functionally useless.  Cleaned up a lot of
global definitions.  Will likely have to re-insert such definitions for the
likely future feature addition of user-definable key-bindings.
(fixed, changed, added) more than a handful of other things that I didn't
remember writing down in this changelog.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.6.3 ---------------------------------
(fixed) a visual bug that existed from the beginning.  When saving, it used to
say 'open' on the button...now it says 'save'.  No big deal.  But still neat.
(fixed) a problem with paths on windows systems with recursive environment
variables (like HOME=%USERPROFILE%).
(known bug) there exists a bug in automatic word wrapping.  This is within
wxSTC, not PyPE.  For an example of this bug in action, I've provided some
code in the wxWindows bug page here:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=816227&group_id=9863&atid=109863
(slight refactor) I didn't like the repeated 'parent' references for different
items when it wasn't so much a 'parent' as much as it was referring to the
actual topmost frame of the application (especially when such references
called functions that only existed in the topmost frame).  I've changed such
references from 'parent' to 'root', where it makes sense, as well as creating
some other names in other classes where appropriate.
(fixed) a bug involving creating a dialog describing an exception when an
exception occurred.
(fixed) a few tiny bugs in find/replace (one would only notice the non-fatal
bugs if one switched tabs during a find/replace dialog).
(fixed) aforementioned bug from the 1.6 changelog with recently open files.  I
completely forgot about it until I was reading the older changelogs today to
remember how far PyPE has come.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.6.2 ---------------------------------
(fixed) apparently the textwrap module in Python 2.3 doesn't work the way I
wanted it to.  As a result, text wrapping with Python 2.3 and the Windows
binary didn't work in PyPE 1.6.1.  I've removed the code responsible, and it
should work identically between Python 2.2 and Python 2.3.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.6.1 ---------------------------------
(fixed) small overflow error when creating unique temporary file for parsing.
Unnoticed due to testing with python 2.3 which automatically casts overflowed
ints to longs.
(added) modifying word wrapping support.  Python 2.3 and Windows binary users
of PyPE will use the textwrap module that is included with Python 2.3,
everyone else gets the featureless 'wrap on newline or spaces' line wrapper.
The included gpl.txt has now been wrapped using this feature.  Check the edit
menu.
(added) non-modifying word wrapping support.  Went looking through the STC
documentation and found support for it.  Check the edit menu.
(added) some small pieces that will allow future state information to be
displayed in a field within the statusbar.


#--------------------------------- PyPE 1.6 ----------------------------------
(please note) I am going on vacation from September 3 to September 14.  Any
bug reports will be silently ignored until at least the 15th.  If you have
problems using 1.6, try using 1.5.1 until I get back to you.

(made better) user profile path discovery.  Thanks Erik Lechak.
(fixed) if the user profile cannot be saved, you will get a dialog informing
you of this.  Previously, this was not the case, it would be silently ignored.
(fixed) there was a bug in the recently open documents menu that would cause
certain documents to be placed in the menu, and others not to be.  From now
on, any document opened will be placed in the menu.  The document will have
the file name and path normalized, as per os.path.normcase and
os.path.normpath.  This will result in duplicate file entries until the menu
gets cleared out of old entries for Windows users, as the menu thinks there is
a difference between c:\doc.txt and C:\Doc.TXT on Windows.  You can speed this
up by dragging and dropping 9 random text files onto PyPE.
(fixed) a foolish bug that stopped me from using map anywhere in PyPE, I had
assigned map to be a mapping for the find/replace dialog stuff.
(changed) Code snippets are now optionally turned off in the view menu.  In
turning off code snippets, then closing down and starting back up PyPE, you
will no longer have a code snippet bar on the left side, nor will the hot keys
work.  For those people who use code snippets, I'll do my best to not remove
the functionality, and keep it an option, but may arbitrarily remove it in the
2.x series, if development proceeds that far.
(added) goto line as a menu command and hotkey.  I've been wanting it for a
while, and it was requested by another user.  So I added it.
(added) the option to add a search path for modules.  This is a setting that
will be saved, and is of primary use for those using the windows binary on a
system with Python installed.  To tell the truth, I've been using the binary
for a while; it starts up faster.  This addition makes the binary as powerful
as the source version.  To remove paths from the module search, one must delve
into the history.txt file.  I really should write an abstracted class to
handle pathmarks, shell commands and module paths...maybe in a later version.
(fixed) inserted a minor change that fixed the autoindent for lines that
contain slices.
(changed) hitting F5 will now cause the slow parser to do its magic, and if it
fails (due to a syntax error), the fast parser will kick in.  If you always
want the fast parser to work, just leave a syntax error in your source until
just before you run it.  When opening multiple files, they will be parsed in
series with the slow parser.
(cleaned up) some imports, variable declarations, etc.
(tried to change but failed) I had attempted to make all parsing occur in the
background with an additional thread so that the GUI wouldn't seize up.
Unfortunately, there seems to be a bug with either Python garbage collection,
wxStyledTextCtrl, or STCStyleEditor.py.  How do I know?  Because doing any
operation that causes garbage to be generated (for the garbage collector to
collect) while updating the wxStyledTextCtrl component with the STCStyleEditor
module causes a garbage collection error in both Python 2.2 and Python 2.3.
Certainly I can spend a few weeks testing and inserting locks around portions
that could cause problems, but I will not.  On the upside, I'm really good at
creating new events, event handlers, and other such things, so if there ever
is a need for background processing (IE the garbage collection error gets
fixed), It'll be a 5-minute job.
(finally succeeded) the trick to getting background parsing lay within the use
of os.popen4.  Keeping the parsing out of process fixed the problem I was
having, and I could even use some threads to wait for the child.stdout.read()
to complete.  Works fabulously.  It takes about 110% as long to do it as an
external process (through the use of a=repr(obj), eval(a) and pipes), but that
is OK as it no longer delays the GUI.  Ah HAH!  Spelunkers into the code will
notice that I'm actually calling the editor itself...with an argument of
'--parse', and I've also done away with runscript.py, by calling the editor
itself using '--exec' as an argument.
(changed parsing) the current parsing method does not use pipes or threads,
and also limits itself to parsing one file at any one time (I've dropped 20
files onto PyPE with the threading approach, and PyPE would not respond for
a while).  Now PyPE is always responsive (as long as your processor has
available cycles).
(fixed) it seems as though runscript.py was never included in the windows-only
version of PyPE.   No worries, it is now a part of the editor, so should just
work.
(fixed) there seemed to be a long-standing bug in calling PyPE with relative
command line arguments for files to open.  This has been fixed.  There is a
minor bug relating to the recently open files menu, but that'll be fixed when
I get back from vacation.
(fixed) my constant misspellings of hierarchy, I had been incorrectly spelling
it as heirarchy.  Misspelling pointed out by my wife.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.5.1 ---------------------------------
(fixed) a little bug with autoindent after [else, try, except, finally]
statements.  I forgot to add them into the autoindent stuff.
(fixed) another little bug with autoindent.  It wouldn't autoindent after a
[if, else, etc.] if the cursor was after the last character in the document.
(fixed) another little problem with autoindent.  Had to do with certain kinds
of nested declarations.  Damn, autoindent is almost more trouble than it is
worth.


#--------------------------------- PyPE 1.5 ----------------------------------
(fixed) a little problem when finding line endings in some ambiguous files.
Ambiguous files being files lacking any sort of line endings.
(fixed) autocompletion popping up during typing in strings and comments.  Now
it doesn't.  It would before.  A single line change.
(removed) keywords from the autocomplete stuff.  Why?  Because having to hit
return twice for the keywords [raise, return, pass] was annoying as hell.
(removed) duplicate "import keyword" statement in parsers.slow_parser
(fixed) autoindentation after a definition works better.  Not quite as good as
idle yet, but getting there.
(fixed) remember when you would hit 'F5' with the browsable source tree
expanded and it would remove all your expansions?  This was due to clearing
and reconstructing the tree.  Due to a user asking, "could you stop this",
I've altered PyPE to remove this bulk clear and reconstruction.  It now
updates the data as necessary, only removing or adding nodes as needed.  It is
nifty.
(fixed) with the introduction of the 'remember the last path that was open'
when starting up PyPE again functionality, it introduced a bug.  If one
attempted to use a pathmark or use the recently opened documents menu, it
wouldn't clear the last open path.  This has now been remedied.  Any time you
open a document using the recent menu, or use a pathmark, it will now change
it properly (instead of forcing you to hit 'cancel' in the open dialog, then
try to open again).  In other words, it works like you expect it to now.
(stymied) Autoindent like idle does is going to be hard.  This is because idle
actually does a large amount of parsing.  I have a feeling this is why it is
sometimes sluggish.  I could be wrong.
(good enough) I think the current autoindent code works just fine for most
things.  It certainly isn't as complete as idle, but I think it would be out
of line for the entire document to be parsed at every newline insertion.
Unless the need bites me, I'm not going to insert dedent code for [raise,
return, pass]
(fixed) Dedenting on a single line will now keep your cursor in the original
relative position to the remaining of the line.  It will also remove partial
indentations before removing a full indentation.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.4.2 ---------------------------------
(fixed) some stupid bugs with loading and saving of history/pathmarks/shell
commands into history.txt.  Sorry about that.  The 1.4 series of PyPE has
proven itself to be the buggiest series ever.  *grumble*


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.4.1 ---------------------------------
(fixed) a problem with pathmarks introduced by the 'remember the last path you
were in when PyPE last closed' addition.  Yes, this fix gets it's own version.


#--------------------------------- PyPE 1.4 ----------------------------------
(added) in commenting/uncommenting feature thanks to Mark Tipton's adaptation
of some codeEditor code.
(added) in a few things to give the parsers a couple more options.  The slow
parser is still slow.  It may be replaced by one that uses the compiler
module.
(change) there is a new 'slow' parser in included with PyPE parsers module.
Instead of using the standard parser python module, it uses the compiler
module.  This is better for a few reasons; it is faster, all the information
that is needed for the browsable source tree, autocompletion, and even
docstrings (for pulling out tooltips) are available.  Speaking of which...
(submissions by Mark Tipton)
cmt-001 - 08/06/2003: Added code to configuration.py to create a configuration
directory to store user-related configuration information.  Added code to
pype.py to store an opened file history that is displayed at the bottom of the
file menu and that saves the directory of the last file opened and starts
there the next time you start pype.
cmt-002 - 08/06/2003: I couldn't get the 'runScript' function to work on
Linux. It seemed to be related to files and directories with spaces in the
name. The function was drastically modified (actually completely replaced)
using code from PythonCard's codeEditor and seems to work on both Linux and
Windows XP.
(changed) now pathmarks, shell commands (as well as the new history.txt) are
stored in <HOME>/.pype, where HOME is an environment variable set to be the
path of your home directory, or the directory in which PyPE is currently
running if the HOME environment variable is not set.
(cleanup) After discovering that wxMenu will handle the majority of one's
accelerator hotkey needs, I've cleaned up a bit of the code, removing some
of what was remining in MainWindow.OnKeyPressed.  Here's hoping that I don't
forget to test some hotkey by the time 1.4 is released.
(fixed) a few minor misspellings in some comments.
(added) some help stuff.
(added) a native win32 build of PyPE due to request, thanks to py2exe.  I'll
try to remember to build a win32 native version every time.  If someone out
there in linuxland wants to build a linux native version using Gordon
McMillan's Installer (available at http://www.mcmillan-inc.com/install1.html),
I would happily post it.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.3.1 ---------------------------------
(added) a version checker to PyPE.  If you are running a version of wxPython
before 2.4.1.2, and PyPE worked before I added this, please email me with the
version string of wxPython you were using, which can be found by running this
(without the single quotes) python -c "import wx;print wx.VERSION_STRING"
To email me, head to http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jcarlson/contact.html


#--------------------------------- PyPE 1.3 ----------------------------------
(confirmed) As believed, PyPE 1.2 and later work with Python 2.3.  No worries
about upgrading, but no requirements either.  I'll be developing with 2.2, but
will test all releases from now on with 2.3 as well.  I don't forsee any
issues involved with the transition to Python 2.3 in the future.  In the next
6 months, if I happen to use features added in Python 2.3 (like enumerate), I
will make sure to include a work-alike for those of us who migrate a few
months after a Python release.
(changed) now when you open a .txt file the text styling will be used.
(changed) the text style now uses a monospaced font (because non-monospaced
text in an editor like PyPE is just plain ugly).
(fixed) a little bug in MainWindow.OnDrop, where a failed file open should
open up a dialog explaining why the open failed, but would instead cause
another exception.  Ick.
(added) a very rudimentary hierarchical python parser.  It only pays attention
to leading spaces in function and class definitions.  That is why I call it
rudimentary.  All bug reports regarding the hierarchical python parser will be
ignored.  Patches for making the parser better will be merged, likely used,
and properly attributed.
(added) "autocompletion" dropdown for keyword/function/method completion.
Accessable via CTRL-<space>.
(added) a browsable source tree per open document.  Check the view menu.  It
uses an iterative method rather than a recursive method which could go beyond
the interpreter's recursion limit for very deep source files.
(left in) the stub for adding tooltips.  I dig tooltips, but I don't really
want to add the code for sucking tooltips out of the first line of a method or
module's docstring.  Maybe 1.4, maybe.
(fixed) a bug with dropping files to open onto an already open document.
(fixed) a bug where cut/paste/undo/redo by keyboard wouldn't mark the document
as being 'dirty' with the little asterisk next to the file name.  Now whenever
one uses cut/paste/undo/redo causes the document to become dirty, even when
nothing actually changes.  I think this is better.
(discovered) window.SetFocus(), a nice little thing that gives keyboard focus
to objects derived from wxWindow (most everything is), thanks to oZt that
popped into the #python channel who was looking for such a thing, that made me
curious as well.  Now things like double-clicking on code-snippets and on
the browsable source tree will now give source editor focus.  Sweet.
(fixed) some bugs with portions of the window not redrawing.
(added) two parsers for the browsable source tree.  A fast one, and an
accurate one.  The fast one can parse PyPE 1.3 in .08 seconds.  The accurate
one can parse PyPE 1.3 in 4 seconds.  These times are on my PII-400.  By
default, the fast one will be in use, this is for two reasons; the first being
speed (no one wants a slow source browser refresh), the second being that the
slow parser (which uses the parser module) dies during the creation of the
syntax tree if there are any syntax errors in your source, making it somewhat
useless during development.  If anyone can offer anything better than either
for what they are doing, I would be very happy to give you credit for your
work.  Any bug reports on the fast parser being inaccurate will be ignored.
Any bug reports on the slow parser being slow or not working on non-working
code will be ignored.  If you'd like to test the parsers, give this a try:
'./parsers.py pype.py' to find out how fast either would take to parse PyPE on
your system.  One thing to note is that the slow parser, because it uses the
parser module, has a few problems with line numbers (many lines that are in
triple quoted strings are considered one line, and comment lines are discarded
completely), so the slow parser uses the fast parser to get line numbers.
Kinda funny really.  The accurate one (in terms of hierarchy) is completely
off in terms of line numbers.  HAH!
(fixed) a little bug regarding comment insertion.  If one would hit cancel, it
would have caused an exception...that was ignored.
(confirmed) still works with Python 2.2 and 2.3.


#--------------------------------- PyPE 1.2 ----------------------------------
(changed) pathmarks are always saved on program exit.
(added) command line argument support with the use of os.path.abspath for all
the relational and absolute path references for all systems.  I like when what
I need has already been implemented.  Multiple file arguments also just work.
(fixed) a bug with path normalization and whether a file was open already.
(forgot) to remove some of the drag and drop stuff in the previous version...
(added) drag and drop file support.  Enabled by default, but can be disabled
in the text-editing portion for text dnd support.  Why don't I just write a
control for dnd text and files?  Because I REALLY don't want to, and don't
know if it can even be done (I have a feeling it can be, just not with
wxFileDropTarget and wxTextDropTarget).
(discovered) os.linesep, a great little declaration that has replaced a few if
then elif then else statements in configuration.py.  I knew there had to be
something like that in the os module.
(added) an 'open module' functionality similar to what I remember of older
IDLE, though this one searches in an identical fashion to the way an 'import'
statement would in later versions of Python, that is, it includes hierarchical
module importing, as well as the current path in the search for a module.
(cleaned) some duplicated code out.  Opening a file, a module, or dropping a
file onto PyPE causes the same code to run.  Isn't that nice?  I think so.
Code duplication leads to bugs.  Bugs are bad.
(fixed) save as dialog would offer multiple wildcards, made it give *.*
instead so that I wouldn't have to write automatic file extension code for
right now.  This may actually be added by the time this minor release is
released.
(fixed) if you loaded a document and undo once, it will clear the document.  I
kept forgetting to get rid of this, but thanks to the project's first official
bug report on sourceforge, I had the reason to add the line required to
pype.PythonSTC.SetText - thanks anonymous bug poster.
(fixed) that REALLY ugly code for changing style update information.  It used
to create an entirely new page, load the text, copy all the state information
(except for undo), then replace the current page.  It has now been replaced by
the same style change that is done upon loading, and it just works.  I like it
when that happens.  No messy copying, wxStyledTextCtrl just works.
(made pretty) the menu item hotkeys used to be vertically aligned as best I
could by hand...then I noticed how they do menus in the wxPython demo; tabs.
Repaired all the menu items with tabs, and now they are consistent, if not
pretty (insert maniacal laugh).
(made better) you know how pathmarks used to always have that menu that was
filled up, even when no pathmarks were being used?  Not anymore.  They now
change as your pathmarks are changing.  How's that for spiffy?  Idea thanks to
the wxPython demo app.
(fixed) previously when one would go step by step in the find/replace dialog,
it wouldn't select the next found object when a replacement had been made.
This has been fixed.
(fixed) small bug that caused an exception after finding and replacing all, it
wouldn't kill PyPE, but it was a foolish mistake.
(added) code snippet support.  See the FAQ portion of the readme for how to
use it.  They are available as menu commands in the lower portion of the view
menu.
(fixed) when adding or deleting pathmarks, when the window pops up again, it
used to select the first entry every time, it now selects the previously
selected entry.  This should stop you from losing your first pathmark if you
accidentally hit 'OK' on a deletion.
(added) shell command execution support.  Uses os.spawnv in windows,
os.spawnvp everywhere else that supports it.  The windows version is not able
to scan your paths to find an executable (hence why it is 'v' and not 'vp').
Whether this is a limitation of something in windows, python or otherwise, I
have no idea.  Just don't blame me.  Dynamic menus abound.
(cleaned) up some exception dialog stuff.  Removed some duplicated code.
(reorganized) the menus somewhat.  Items have been relocated to menus that are
much more intuitive.
(changed) along with pathmarks; code snippets and shell commands are saved at
program exit.  All three are stored in pathmarks.py


#--------------------------------- PyPE 1.1 ----------------------------------
(cleaned) I did some house cleaning and started using wxNewId to generate
event ids rather than doing them manually.  This required a few tweaks to the
menu generation code, but it cleaned up nicely.  It is also quite consistent
now (wheee, consistency).
(cleaned) I also added a few more functions to deal with previously opened
files easier.
(added) wxSplitterWindow control to hold some extra goodies on the left of the
window.  Just wait for what I have in store for you.  As the controls that I
have added do not support keypress events (other than the menu alt-commands),
hot-keys are only useful when a document is open, or when you haven't touched
the splitter bar or other controls after documents have been closed.
(confirmed) The line ending corruption fix for 1.0.1 seem to be working great.
(fixed) Discovered and removed a bug when inserting a comment would mess up
line endings in the surrounding lines, making it look like there was an extra
blank line inserted on windows systems.  Replaced a '+1' with
'+len(win.format)'.  I like easy fixes.
(tweaked) Line ending detection so that it does something a bit more
intelligent.  It works better on strange files now.
(fixed) undoing and redoing previously wouldn't mark the document as being
'dirty', this is fixed and merged with the code for cut and paste making the
document dirty through the use of a dictionary.  This brings up the question
as to whether or not ALL keypress events should just be a dictionary lookup
rather than a sequence of if, elif, else statements.  They probably should.
Maybe in the next minor version.
(removed) the aforementioned splitter window for now.
(cleaned) up the handling of many of the hotkeys that are used via a
ctrl-<key> combinations.  Basically all but two of the ctrl hotkeys are in a
dictionary for O(1) lookups.  I like that.
(reorganized) some of the menu command locations.
(added) pathmark support.  Viewing pathmarks, editing pathmarks, deleting
pathmarks and saving pathmarks to the configuration file.  MMM, pathmarks.
(added) more status bar text updates, like closing, opening, creating new, and
other such things.  I like updates.
(fixed) undoing and redoing of changing tabs is now done by the entire block
that was tabbed/untabbed, not by the individual line as before.
(discovered) how to use the shift and control clicking of the scope-based
collapseable blocks.  Updated the help to explain how they work.
(contemplated) adding drag and drop support.  After spending some time mucking
around it, I have decided it can wait until the next minor release.
(contemplated) adding code snippet support.  It's where you have a listing of
named code snippets that double clicking will cause to replace the current
selection (or insert at the current cursor position).  I'm trying to decide
how/where to place the code snippets.  I've come to enjoy having a full screen
for editing code, and to lose some of it to code snippets, almost seems
strange.  It'll probably be in the next point release with file drag and drop
support.


#-------------------------------- PyPE 1.0.1 ---------------------------------
(fixed) Thanks to a message from Lunar Linux guru Jeff Hodges, I was turned on
to Pychecker.sourceforge.net and have discovered two previously unknown
unpassed arguments to functions.  While pychecker is useful, it returns a lot
of variable not used errors.  I'll use it before every .n version release
after I do a couple more feature additions.
(fixed) Also thanks to Jeff Hodges, I discovered a bug in 1.0 that will tend
to produce line endings that are \r\r\n...which is wrong, for ANY system.  It
is now fixed.  It had to do with reading and writing files in ascii mode, not
in binary mode.  Apparently it makes a difference in terms of line endings.
Who knew?
