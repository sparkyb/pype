<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" name="requirements">Requirements</a></h1>
<p>Either a machine running Python and wxPython, or a Windows machine that can
run the binaries should be sufficient.  Initial revisions of PyPE were
developed on a PII-400 with 384 megs of ram, but it should work on any machine
that can run the most recent wxPython revisions.  Some portions may be slow
(Document-&gt;Wrap Long Lines especially, which is a known issue with the
scintilla text editor control), but it should still be usable.</p>
<p>PyPE 2.x has only been tested on Python 2.3 and wxPython 2.6.3.0.  It should
work on later versions of Python and wxPython.  If you are having issues, file
a bug report on <a class="reference" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pype">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pype</a> .</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" name="installation">Installation</a></h1>
<p>If you have Python 2.3 or later as well as wxPython 2.6.3 or later, you can
extract PyPE-X.Y.Z-src.zip anywhere and run it by double-clicking on pype.py
or pype.pyw .  If you want to be all official, you can use
'python setup.py install', but that is generally unnecessary.</p>
<p>If you don't have Python 2.3 wxPython 2.6.3 or later, and are running Windows,
you should (hopefully) be able to run the Windows binaries.  They are provided
for your convenience (so you don't have to install Python and wxPython).</p>
<p>If it so happens that the Windows binaries don't work for you, and you have an
installation of Python and wxPython that fits the requirements, why don't you
run the source version?  The only difference is a pass through py2exe, and a
minor loading time speed increase.  Just because the Windows binaries exist,
doesn't mean that you /have/ to run them.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-doesn-t-the-windows-install-work">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7" name="why-doesn-t-the-windows-install-work">Why doesn't the Windows install work?</a></h2>
<p>Depending on your platform, it may or may not work.  It works for me on
Windows 2k, XP and 98.  Most problems people have is that they mistakenly
extract library.zip, which they shouldn't do.  It could also be due to the
lack of some DLL, in which case an error message should inform you of what DLL
you are missing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-doesn-t-pype-work-on-linux">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" name="why-doesn-t-pype-work-on-linux">Why doesn't PyPE work on Linux?</a></h2>
<p>PyPE 2.5+ has been tested on Ubuntu 6.06 with...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>python-wxversion_2.6.1.2ubuntu2_all.deb</li>
<li>libwxgtk2.6-0_2.6.1.2ubuntu2_i386.deb</li>
<li>python-wxgtk2.6_2.6.1.2ubuntu2_i386.deb</li>
</ul>
<p>The only anomalies observed so far is seemingly a bug with some
wx.ScrolledPanel uses, specifically the 'Search' tab along the bottom not
displaying all of the options for searching within files.  Making the bottom
set of tools larger, then using a hotkey to show/hide the tools whenever
necessary is a workable (if not ugly and inconvenient) workaround.</p>
<p>PyPE 2.5+ has also been tested on Kubuntu 6.06 after the installation of the
Synaptic packaage manager, which may or may not have introduced other Gtk
libraries that may or may not affect its performance.  On Kubuntu, there are
a large number of errors and/or warnings during PyPE startup, but I have not
been able to crash PyPE yet, so I presume it is stable.</p>
<p>There have previously been reports of PyPE segfaulting in certain Linux
distributions when opening a file.  This seems to be caused by icons in the
file listing in the 'Documents' tab on the right (or left) side of the editor
(depending on your preferences), or by icons in the notebook tabs along the
top of the editor.  It was due to either the platform not being able to find
the icons to display, or the icons being improperly sized.  You can disable
these icons by starting up PyPE, going to Options-&gt;Use Icons, and making sure
that it is unchecked.  You should restart PyPE to make sure that the setting
sticks.  PyPE will be uglier, but it should work.  I believe that this has
been fixed in PyPE 2.4.1 and later, but this documentation persists &quot;just in
case&quot;.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-isn-t-the-most-recent-pype-available-as-deb-or-rpm">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" name="why-isn-t-the-most-recent-pype-available-as-deb-or-rpm">Why isn't the most recent PyPE available as deb or RPM?</a></h2>
<p>Short answer: it's a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Longer answer: I'm not the maintainer for the PyPE package, but have recently
discovered that PyPE has a new debian maintainer.  Whether or not the new
debian maintainer keeps PyPE up-to-date is up to him.  Personal attempts to
create .debs have resulted in utter failure, which I can either blame on a
personal failure to comprehend the documentation, or a failure in the
documentation to impart the necessary information.  Either way, you are going
to have to wait for the debian/ubuntu/whatever repositories to update.  You
can always get the most recent PyPE from <a class="reference" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pype">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pype</a></p>
<p>I'm not going to package any RPMs for PyPE, primarily because I'm not going to
install the RPM build/install stuff into Ubuntu.  Recent attempts to get
bdist_wininst working in such a way that the results don't mangle Python
installations have failed, and this experience leads me to believe that
bdist_rpm has similar issues.  Essentially, you are on your own with regards
to rpm packages.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10" name="why-doesn-t-pype-work-on-osx">Why doesn't PyPE work on OSX?</a></h2>
<p>I have had no reports of PyPE working or not working on any version of OSX.  I
don't have a Mac, and I'm not too keen on running a hacked version of OSX on
X86 hardware, so unless someone is willing to donate or test, I'll continue to
have no idea of whether it runs or not.</p>

<div class="section" id="last">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12" name="last">--last</a></h2>
<p>When PyPE is run with the '--last' command line option, PyPE will attempt to
load all documents that were opened the last time you shut down PyPE.  This is
equivalent to starting up PyPE and using File-&gt;Open Last .</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unicode-and-ansi">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13" name="unicode-and-ansi">--unicode and --ansi</a></h2>
<p>If PyPE is started up with the --unicode or --ansi command line options, it
will attempt to use the unicode or ansi versions of wxPython respectively.  On
failure, it will display to the user with a failure notice.  These options
have no effect on the Windows distributions of PyPE, or wherever 
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hasattr(sys,</span> <span class="pre">'frozen')</span></tt> is true.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nothread">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14" name="nothread">--nothread</a></h2>
<p>This command line option will disable the threaded parser, which may cause
problems on some platforms.  This will reduce the accuracy of the tools in
the &quot;Tools&quot; menu, due to the faster and not necessarily correct parser.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="macros">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15" name="macros">--macros</a></h2>
<p>PyPE 2.6 has an almost fully-functioning macro system.  The Python 2.5
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--macros</span></tt> command line option is now ignored because macros are enabled by
default in 2.6+.</p>

<p>When selecting multiple lines for a cut/copy operation, Sloppy Cut/Copy will

<div class="section" id="what-is-smart-paste">

<p>Smart Paste is two functionalities in one.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>When pasting multiple lines into a currently indented region, it will
reindent the pasted region such that the least indented line of the pasted
region matches the current indentation level, all other indent levels being
relative to the current/minimum.</li>
<li>When the cursor is in a non-indent portion of a line, and you paste, Smart
Paste will automatically paste to the next line, indenting one level deeper
as necessary if you had selected the start of a new block (like if, for,
while, def, etc., for Python, open curly braces '{' in C, etc.).</li>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20" name="dictionaries-and-alphabets-for-the-spell-checker">Dictionaries and alphabets for the Spell checker</a></h2>
<p>You can create/delete custom dictionaries via the +/- buttons right next to
the &quot;Custom Dictionaries:&quot; section.  You can add words to these custom
dictionaries by &quot;Check&quot;ing your document for misspellings, checking all of the
words you want to add, clicking &quot;+ ./&quot;, then choosing the custom dictionary
you want the words added to.</p>
<p>If you want to use a large primary dictionary, create a 'dictionary.txt' file
that is utf-8 encoded, and place it into the same path that PyPE is.  This
will be far faster for startup, shutdown, and creating the list than manually
adding all of the words to custom dictionaries.  Fairly reasonable word lists
for english (British, Canadian, or American) are available at Kevin's Word 
list page: <a class="reference" href="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/">http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/</a> Words should be separated by any
standard whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line endings, etc.).</p>
<p>If you want to customize the alphabet that PyPE uses for suggesting spelling,
you can create an 'alphabet.txt' file that is utf-8 encoded, where alphabet
characters separated by commas ',', and place it into the same path that PyPE
is.</p>
<p>Please note that the spell checker is very simple.  After discovering &quot;words&quot;,
which are contiguous sequences of letters, suggestions are created by removing
single letters, inserting single letters, and swapping pairs of letters
internally.  It then checks these suggestions against the user-supplied
dictionaries, and any that match become suggestions.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21" name="how-does-one-pype-work">How does &quot;One PyPE&quot; work?</a></h2>
<p>If &quot;One PyPE&quot; is selected, it will remove the file named 'nosocket' from the
path in which PyPE is running from (if it exists), and start a listening
socket on 127.0.0.1:9999 .  If &quot;One PyPE&quot; is deselected, it will create a file
called 'nosocket' in the path from which PyPE is running, and close the
listening socket (if one was listening).</p>
<p>Any new PyPE instances which attempt to open will check for the existence of
the nosocket file.  If it does not find that file, it will attempt to create a
new listening socket on 127.0.0.1:9999 .  If the socket creation fails, it
will attempt to connect to 127.0.0.1:9999 and send the documents provided on
the command-line to the other PyPE instance.  If it found the file, or if it
was able to create the socket, then a new instance of PyPE will be created,
and will use the preferences-defined &quot;One PyPE&quot; (preventing certain issues
involving a read-only path which PyPE is on, or a read-only nosocket file).</p>
<p>If you want to prevent new instances of PyPE from ever creating or using
sockets, create a file called 'nosocket' and make it read-only to PyPE.</p>

<p>What other nifty things are possible?  How about automatic curly and square
brace matching with [, [%C] and {, {%C}?  Note that triggers with a single
character in the 'enter' column are automatically done as you type, but
triggers with multiple characters in the 'input' column require using
Transofrms-&gt;Perform Trigger (or its equivalent hotkey if you have assigned
one via Options -&gt; Change Menus and Hotkeys).</p>
<p>As described, there is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%C</span></tt> directive that defines where the cursor will
end up.  There is also a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%L</span></tt> directive that inserts a line break with
autoindentation.  The semantics for string escapes are the same as in the
Find/Replace bar, and a non-indenting line break can be inserted with the
standard <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\n</span></tt>.</p>

<p>If you have ' or &quot; as the first character in a find or find/replace entry, and
what you entered is a proper string declaration in Python, PyPE will use the
compiler module to parse and discover the the string.  For example, to
discover LF characters, use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;\n&quot;</span></tt>, including quotes.</p>

<p>You can use standard Python strings with escapes and quote marks just like
when you use the find/replace bars with one minor difference; all searched
data is normalized to have <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\n</span></tt> line endings regardless of the input.  This
means that if you want to find a colon followed by a line ending followed by
a space, you would use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;:\n</span> <span class="pre">&quot;</span></tt>, including quotes.</p>
<p>If you include line endings in your search string, then multiline searching
will be automatically enabled during the search (but the box will remain

<div class="section" id="the-c-c-parser">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id29" name="the-c-c-parser">The C/C++ parser</a></h3>
<p>The recently added C/C++ parser uses a combination of regular expressions and
a few checks to extract function definition information.  Note that it can
handle things like the following and their variations:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int ** foo(char* arg1, int larg1) \{ ...

str1 myClass :: operator[] (indices, count)
int* indices;
int count;
\{ ...
</pre>
<p>Generally speaking, it searches for all matches of the following regular
expressions for function-like examples of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#define</span></tt> and functions
respectively:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(#ys+i\(i(?:,s*i)*\))
(?:(cs*\([^\)]*\))[^{;\)]*[;{])
</pre>
<p>Where the following replacements are made, in-order to the regular expressions
prior to matching:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
c -&gt; (?:i|operator[^\w]+)
i -&gt; (?:[a-zA-Z_]\w*)
s -&gt; [ \t]
y -&gt; (?:[dD][eE][fF][iI][nN][eE])
</pre>
<p>The function-like macros are returned unchanged, while the possible function
matches have various other tests performed on them, and the addition of
everything on the same line as the potential function definition.</p>
<p>Note that the parser doesn't recognize struct definitions, data members of
classes, class hierarchies, functions with default values, etc.  It should be
sufficient for most navigation and/or</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-python-parser">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id30" name="the-python-parser">The Python parser</a></h3>
<p>For Python source files, if given a syntactically correct Python source file,
the Python parser should work without issue (as long as --nothread is not
provided), though it may not be quite as fast as desired (where fast is &lt; .1
seconds).  Recent versions of PyPE have a much faster &quot;slow&quot; parser than
previous versions, but it is still limited to syntactically correct source
files.</p>
<p>If not given a syntactically correct Python source file (or if --nothread was
provided as a command line option), the parser splits the file into lines,
performing a check to see if there is a function, class, or comment on that
line, then saves the hierarchy information based on the level of indentation
and what came before it.  This can be inaccurate, as it will mistakenly
believe that the below function 'enumerate' is a method of MyException.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class MyException(Exception):
    pass
try:
    enumerate
except:
    def enumerate(inp):
        return zip(range(len(inp)), inp)
</pre>
<p>It also doesn't know anything about multi-line strings, so the definition nada
in the following lines would be seen as a function, and not part of a string.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
'''
this used to be a function
def nada(inp):
    return None
'''
</pre>
<p>This parser will also not pull out doc strings or handle multi-line function
definitions properly.</p>
<p>PyPE still needs a real parser for C, so it only extracts \todo: items.  What
precisely a parser would do on TeX/LaTeX, HTML or XML is beyond me, so they
also only extract %todo: and &lt;!-- todo: --&gt; items respectively.</p>

<p>PyPE will attempt to figure out what kind of file was opened, it does this by
counting the number of different kinds of line endings.  Which ever line
ending appears the most in an open file will set the line ending support for
viewing and editing in the window.  Also, any new lines will have that line
ending.  New files will have the same line endings as the host operating
system.</p>
<p>Additionally, copying from an open document will not change the line-endings.
Future versions of PyPE may support the automatic translation of text during
copying and pasting to/from the host operating system's native line endings.</p>
<p>Converting between line endings is a menu item that is available in the
'Document' menu.</p>

<p>Users of PyPE 2.5.1 (a test release) and later will have the ability to
record, edit, playback, and delete macros.  Most keyboard related tasks are
recorded (typing, keyboard movement, selection, cut, copy, paste, etc.), as
are all items in the Transforms menu; including automatic and manual triggers.</p>
<p>Any macro without any action performed will not be recorded.  That is, if you
hit &quot;Start Recording&quot; and do nothing other than hit &quot;Stop Recording&quot;, a macro
will not be created.  If you would like to create an initially empty macro,
you can use &quot;Empty Macro&quot; and it will get everything all set up for you.</p>
<p>Before you execute your macro, I encourage you to save all currently open
documents.  While I haven't experienced any recent crashes or segfaults while
using macros, I may not be able to replicate your particular crash condition
even if given the macro source, so may not be able to fix your problem.  Be
careful!</p>
<p>Let us assume that you have created an initially empty macro with the &quot;Empty
Macro&quot; button, whose contents are something like the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

missing, you will see the file name instead.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">def</span> <span class="pre">macro(self):</span></tt></dt>
<dd>is the initial definition of the macro.  You can have any number of helper
functions, extra data, etc., but the macro itself must be named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">macro</span></tt>,
and must take at least one argument, the first of which being the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wxStyledTextCtrl</span></tt> instance that contains the current document.  You can

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id41" name="how-do-you-come-up-with-new-feature-ideas">How do you come up with new feature ideas?</a></h2>
<p>Every once and a while, I'll be editing with PyPE, and I'll say, &quot;hey, it
would be neat if I could do X with PyPE&quot;.  This is rare, though it has
produced things like the draggable document list, spell check, customizable
menu hotkey bindings, open module, &quot;One PyPE&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>More often than not, I will be surfing the net, and someone will rant and rave
about their super ultra mega favorite editor X, and how it has so many
features that are so great that no other editor has.  Out of curiosity, I'll
usually go to the specific site, look at the editor, the features it offers,
and consider if I would want PyPE to have such features, what changes would be
necessary, and what it would take to make them happen.  This has produced
things like workspaces, shells, find/replace bars (idea from Firefox),
triggers (and everything else in the Transforms menu), the name and line
oriented browsable source trees, etc.</p>
<p>Occasionally, some user of PyPE will contact me, perhaps report a bug, or
somesuch, and eventually either suggest features or offer up patches.  While
I had written the original Search tab, the current Search tab and the table
display of results were submitted almost complete.  Suggestions have resulted
in the addition of Start/End selection, bookmarks, the line-based abstraction
for macros, macros themselves, tools whose positions can be switched, title
options, the optional toolbar, caret tracking and width options, find/replace
bar history, the actual find/replace bar keybindings and what they do based on
context, the embedded HTML help, the Find Definition/filter tool, etc.</p>
<p>Astute observers will note that I have not really come up with anything
terribly original myself.  However, through observing other editors and IDEs,
and recieving great suggestions from users, I think that PyPE has managed to
acquire some very useful features.  Generally, I have written PyPE primarily
for myself, so if tools have a particular aesthetic or design, it's so that
look and work according to how I think they should (the exception being how
document preferences are handled, I really need to change that design).  I
hope that others find PyPE as natural to use as I do, but if not, then I
welcome your feedback.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id42" name="what-s-the-deal-with-the-version-numbering-scheme">What's the deal with the version numbering scheme?</a></h2>
<p>Early in development, PyPE raised version numbers very quickly.  From 1.0 to
1.5, not much more than 2 months passed.  In that time, most of the major
initial architectural changes that were to happen, happened.  This is not the
reason for the version number change.  Really it was so that the MAJOR
versions could have their own point release (1.0 being the first), and minor
bugfixes on the point releases would get a minor release number (like 1.0.1).</p>
<p>Then, at around PyPE 1.4.2, I had this spiffy idea.  What if I were to release
a series of PyPE versions with the same version numbers as classic Doom?  I
remembered updating to 1.1, then to 1.2a, etc.  My favorite was 1.666.  Ah
hah! PyPE 1.6.6.6, the best version of PyPE ever.</p>
<p>I decided that I would slow version number advancement, if only so that people
didn't get sick of new releases of PyPE being numbered so much higher when
there were minimal actual changes.  Then the more I thought about it, the more
I realized that it doesn't matter at all, I mean, Emacs is on version 20+.
*shrug*</p>
<p>When PyPE 1.9.3 came out, I had a few other ideas for what I wanted to happen,
but since major changes to the underlying architecture were required, it
really should get a major number bump to 2.0.  After spending 3 months not
working on PyPE May-July 2004, I got some time to muck around with it here and
there.  After another few months of trying to rebuild it to only require a
single STC (with multiple document pointers, etc.) I realized that I'd have to
rebuild too much of PyPE to be able to get 2.0 out the door by 2010.  So I
started modifying 1.9.3.  All in all, around 85% of what I wanted made it into
PyPE 2.0, the rest was either architectural (ick), or questionable as to
whether or not anyone would even want to use the feature (even me).</p>

<div class="section" id="how-did-pype-come-about">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id43" name="how-did-pype-come-about">How did PyPE come about?</a></h2>
<p>The beginnings of PyPE were written from 10:30PM on the 2nd of July through
10:30PM on the 3rd of July, 2003.  Additional features were put together on
the 4th of July along with some bug fixing and more testing for version 1.0.
Truthfully, I've been using it to edit itself since the morning of the 3rd of
July, and believe it is pretty much feature-complete (in terms of standard
Python source editing).  There are a few more things I think it would be nice
to have, and they will be added in good time (if I have it).</p>
<p>One thing you should never expect is for PyPE to become an IDE.  Don't expect
a UML diagram.  Don't expect a debugger.  Don't expect debugging support
(what, print statements not good enough for you?)</p>
<p>On the most part, this piece of software should work exactly the way you
expect it to...or at least the way I expect it to.  That is the way I wrote
it.  As a result, you don't get much help in using it (mostly because I am
lazy).  There was a discussion of a PyPE wiki a long time ago, but that will
likely never happen (I've lost contact with the people who initially put
forward the wiki idea, and I have no interest in starting or maintaining one).</p>
<p>The majority of the things that this editor can do are in the menus.  Hotkeys
for things that have them are listed next to their menu items, and you can
both rename menu items and change their hotkeys via Options-&gt;Change Menus and
Hotkeys.</p>

<div class="section" id="thank-yous">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id44" name="thank-yous">Thank Yous</a></h1>
<p>Certainly there are some people I should thank, because without them, the
piece of software you are using right now, just wouldn't be possible.</p>
<p>Guido van Rossum - without Guido, not only would I not have Python, I also
wouldn't have had some of the great inspiration that IDLE has offered.  IDLE
is a wonderful editor, has some excellent ideas in terms of functionality, but
it unfortunately does not offer the extended functionality I want, and it
hurts my brain to use tk, so I cannot add it myself.  Guido, my hat goes off
to you.</p>
<p>The people writing wxWidgets (previously named wxWindows) and wxPython -
without you, this also would not have been possible.  You have made the most
self-consistent GUI libraries that I have ever used, made them easy to use,
and offer them on every platform that I would ever want or need.  You rock.</p>
<p>Neil Hodgson and others who work on Scintilla.  As wx.StyledTextCtrl is a
binding for scintilla in wxWidgets, which then has bindings for wxPython,
basically ALL the REAL functionality of the editor you are now using is the
result of Scintilla.  The additional things like tabbed editing, hotkeys,
etc., they are mere surface decorations in comparison to what it would take to
write everything required for a text editor from scratch.  Gah, an editor
widget that just works?  Who would have figured?</p>
<p>To everyone who I have already thanked: thank you for making PyPE an almost
trivial task.  It would have been impossible to go so far so fast by hand in
any other language using any other GUI toolkit or bindings.</p>
<p>And my wife - because without her, I would likely be a pathetic shell of a
man...or at least single, bored, and uncouth.  Well, I'm probably still
uncouth, but there's only so much a good woman can fix.</p>
